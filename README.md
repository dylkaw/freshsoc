## Overview
**freshSoC** is a comprehensive mobile application tailored for the National University of Singapore's School of Computing (NUS SoC) students. It serves as a one-stop solution for module registration guidance, information queries, and community engagement, specifically crafted to enhance both the academic and social experiences of the SoC student body.

## Motivation
Our mobile application provides students in NUS School of Computing with a user-friendly and informative tool that can help them manage their academic endeavours more effectively.

As students from School of Computing, the motivation came from challenges experienced firsthand when faced with module registration, seeking advice, and connecting with fellow students, especially during our freshmen year. With this app, we aim to provide a one stop solution for SoC students to do all these tasks. The key features of the application are the guide for module registration and planning, a chatbot to answer relevant queries, and a forum site for students to connect with one another.
